Project: NFTickets

NFTickets is a platform that allows you to buy, sell, trade, and collect tokenized and stylized NFT tickets for sporting events, conerts, dinner series, luxury travel and more. Tickets are stored in a collectors wallet on the paltform that can be used for entry to events, or to hold and flex.

Possible Workflow:
Customer sets up profile > customer creates wallet on platform (for fiat and for storing NFT tickets) > customer searches for and purchases NFT ticket from the marketplace > Smart contract handles sale and exchange of the ticket. Transfer triggered upon payment/execution of contract.

Two or Three Immediate Goals for This Project:
1. Create the platform to buy and sell tickets for a given event.
2. Allow the automated exchange of ticket/money between buyer and seller through a smart contract.
3. Store the NFT ticket in a wallet of some sort.
4. Stretch goal: Allow a resale, with a portion of the money from the resale going back to the original seller (our platform.)

Benefits of NFT Ticketing:
1. Lower cost compared to traditional paper tickets. NFT Tickets can be minted, sold, administrated, and transferred more affordably and quickly. They are also         easier to produce.
2. The tickets are provably authentic. We can show the origin, provenance, and eliminate ticket scams. 
3. Tickets can be resold among users, or be designated non-transferrable for specific events. Tickets can also become unlocked after an event for transfer after an     event has passed for collectibility.
4. If the NFT is programmable, we can dictate how it ties into merchandise, promotions, future revenue, or resale splits. For example, if the ticket is resold the       platform may take a small percentage fee. If the ticket is transferred in a large sale as a collectible, we may also take a percentage of the sale. This allows      us to offer promotions and deals to customers, but also generate recurring revenue over the life of the ticket.
5. We can harvest data to better improve ticket sales, adjust pricing, or provide better perks for customers.
6. The ticket is collectible. NFTs allow us to flex wealth and status digitally. Having an attractive, digital and immutable proof of status in our pocket for all       of our high-status events attended is attractive to most people.
